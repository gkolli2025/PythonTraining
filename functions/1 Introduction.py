"""
Functions:
A function is block of statements which performs particular task.

A function is a named block of reusable code that performs a specific task when called.

- Functions are not executed automatically

- To execute a function. we need to make a function call

Types of functions:
1. Predefined (Built-in) functions --> provided by python (ex: max(), min(), print(), input(), list(), tuple(), set(), dict())
2. User defined functions --> Created by the programmer using def keyword.

- All the statements within the function should follow the indentation

syntax:

def functionname(<parameters>):
    statement1
    statement2
    --
    --
    --
    return statement

Advantages:
Code Re-usability: Write a function once, use it multiple times
Modularity: Break complex tasks into smaller tasks
Improved Readability: Easier to understand and maintain
